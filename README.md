# DAO Unict NextJS

This is the frontend repository of a blockchain-based decentralized university management system that functions as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The goal is to create a Dapp that can perform all the typical functions executed by students, professors, administration offices, etc., and replace the centralized approach currently used by universities. 

The project was created as part of a Master's degree thesis in computer engineering, and it uses Blockchain and smart contracts to achieve decentralization. The primary language used for the graphical user interface is NextJS, but other libraries and frameworks like TailwindCSS, Web3UIKit, and Moralis were also utilized.

## Introduction

The DAO Unict NextJS project aims to create a decentralized university management system using blockchain and smart contracts to ensure a more transparent and efficient workflow. It allows students, professors, and administrative offices to perform typical university functions in a secure and decentralized manner. 

This repository contains the frontend of the system, which provides the graphical user interface for the end-users.

## Features

- **Secure authentication and authorization**: The system uses a secure authentication and authorization system to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information and perform certain actions.
- **Decentralized storage and processing**: The use of blockchain and smart contracts ensures that all data and processes are decentralized, reducing the risk of centralized data breaches and outages.
- **Efficient workflow**: The system streamlines typical university functions, making them more efficient and less prone to errors.
- **User-friendly interface**: The frontend interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing end-users to easily navigate and perform tasks.

## Technologies

This repository uses the following technologies:

- **NextJS**: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and customization of user interfaces.
- **Web3UIKit**: A collection of pre-designed React components for building Ethereum-based Dapps.
- **Moralis**: A backend as a service (BaaS) provider for Ethereum-based Dapps.
