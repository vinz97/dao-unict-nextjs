# DAO Unict - an University System Managament based on Ethereum smart contracts - FRONTEND

This project is the main part of my experimental thesis for my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering @ University of Catania. <br />

This Decentralized Autonomous Organization that acts also as Dapp (decentralized application) is intended to replace the centralized approach (like a website) for managing a university system. The DAO manages to perform all the typical functions of students, professors, secretaries, etc through the use of smart contracts and therefore via blockchain. <br />
